# Flutter Monolith

![Flutter Monolith](./docs/res/monolith_logo.png)

An integrated project management toolset that supports modular monolith structures for Flutter projects.
It efficiently manages multiple packages in large-scale Flutter application development,
automating the entire process from development environment setup to production releases.

## 🚀 Challenges Solved

Large-scale Flutter projects face the following challenges:

**Complex Environment Management**

- Cumbersome configuration management for different flavors
- Version control issues with confidential files
- Inconsistent environment setup among developers

**Localization Limitations**

- Flutter's standard internationalization features are only at the application level
- Difficult to implement independent localization per package
- Cannot separate domain logic from translation resources

**iOS Development Complexity**

- Manual management of Xcode project settings
- Distribution of certificates and provisioning profiles
- Difficulty in sharing configurations between teams

**Inefficient Project Management**

- Tedious individual execution of each tool
- Complex configuration in CI/CD environments
- Lack of standardized development workflows

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔧 Integrated Project Management

- **monolith.yaml**: Centralized configuration management
- **Unified Runner**: Execute all features with `dart run monolith_runner:*` commands
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Automated development environment setup

### 🌍 Advanced Localization

- **Module-level Management**: Independent localization resources per package
- **CSV Management**: Multi-language resource definition in simple format
- **Type-safe Access**: Runtime guarantee through auto-generated Mixin classes

### 🔐 Secure Configuration Management

- **Secret Separation**: Exclude confidential files from version control
- **1Password Integration**: Integration with `op inject` command
- **Automatic Deployment**: Safe distribution of Base64 files and text files

### 📱 iOS Development Automation

- **xcodegen Integration**: YAML-based Xcode project generation
- **Environment Variable Injection**: Integration with secret management tools
- **File Creation**: Pre-creation of files necessary for builds

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
dev_dependencies:
  monolith_runner: ^1.0.0
```

### Basic Configuration

Create `monolith.yaml` in the project root:

```yaml
# monolith.yaml
includes:
  - secrets/monolith.yaml

define:
  output_path: secrets/dart-define/
  generate:
    package_name: foundation_metadata
    helper_path: lib/gen/defines.dart
  flavors:
    development:
      FLAVOR: development
      API_URL: https://api-dev.example.com
    production:
      FLAVOR: production
      API_URL: https://api.example.com

localization:
  languages:
    - ja
    - en
  app:
    package_name: app
    arb_path: lib/l10n/
  package:
    path_prefixes:
      - packages/
    resources_path: res/

xcodegen:
  package_name: app
  touch_files:
    - ios/GoogleService-Info.plist

install:
  - path: secrets/android.keystore
    base64_file: op://vault-id/android-keystore/keystore.base64
  - path: app/ios/GoogleService-Info.plist
    base64_file: op://vault-id/google-services/ios-production.plist.base64
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Inject secret data
op inject --force --in-file monolith.yaml --out-file secrets/monolith.yaml

# Setup development environment
dart run monolith_runner:install        # Deploy secret files
dart run monolith_runner:define         # Generate environment constants
dart run monolith_runner:localization   # Generate localization resources
dart run monolith_runner:xcodegen       # Generate Xcode project

# Build application
flutter build ios --dart-define-from-file=secrets/dart-define/production.json
```
